# Introduction to Robotics (2021 - 2022)
Hi! This is the repo where I'll post my homeworks for the Introduction to Robotics course, taken optionally in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Bucharest. Below you'll find pictures and detailed descriptions of the implementations for each homework. Have at least as much fun browsing these as I had making them.

Also you're free to distribute or use this code however you like, as long as you keep it free (free as in freedom) and open source (see attached GNU GPL License v3.0 for more details).

## Homework_1
Our first homework consisted of making use of 3 potentiometers to control each colour of an RGB LED. I read the values of the potentiometers and digitally map them to current intensity values to output to each LED colour. Pretty simple really. Here's some pictures:
